# Duo Finder

Duo Finder is a simple mobile and web application for gamers looking for partners to play a game with.

It's basics was developed during the NEXT LEVEL WEEK IGNITE, an online event provided by RocketSeat for programmers to build a whole functional system within a week.

I will be adding new features in the near future. ;)
